### Feature: Telegram bot token stored in dedicated global file

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- A valid Telegram bot token is available.
- Access to `~/.codex/` on the host machine.

#### Steps
1. In the app UI, open Telegram connection and submit a bot token.
2. Verify file `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` exists.
3. Open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm it contains a `botToken` field.
4. Restart the app server and call Telegram status endpoint from UI to confirm it still reports configured.

#### Expected Results
- Telegram token is persisted in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
- Telegram bridge remains configured after restart.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` to clear saved Telegram token.

### Feature: Current thread context remaining indicator

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread can send prompts to Codex successfully.
- The selected model/app-server emits `thread/tokenUsage/updated` notifications.

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread in the web UI.
2. Note the header area on the right side of the thread title and confirm a `Context` badge is present.
3. If the badge shows `Awaiting data`, send a prompt and wait for Codex to finish at least one turn.
4. After the turn completes, inspect the `Context` badge again.
5. Hover the badge and read the tooltip details.
6. Refresh the page and reopen the same thread.

#### Expected Results
- The current thread header shows a `Context` badge for thread-specific usage state.
- Once a token usage event arrives, the badge shows remaining context (for example `152K left`) and secondary text with used/window counts.
- The tooltip includes current context usage, cumulative thread usage, and remaining context details.
- After refresh, the last known context badge state for that thread is restored from local storage.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Telegram chatIds persisted for bot DM sending

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Telegram bot already configured in the app.
- Access to `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Steps
1. Send `/start` to the Telegram bot from your DM.
2. Wait for the app to process the update, then open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
3. Confirm `chatIds` contains your DM chat id as the first element.
4. In the app, reconnect Telegram bot with the same token.
5. Re-open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm `chatIds` remains present.

#### Expected Results
- `chatIds` is written after Telegram DM activity.
- `chatIds` persists across bot reconfiguration.
- `botToken` and `chatIds` are both present in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `chatIds` or delete `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` to clear persisted chat targets.

### Feature: Skills dropdown closes after selection in composer

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread exists and can be selected.
- At least one installed skill is available.

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread so the message composer is enabled.
2. Click the `Skills` dropdown in the composer footer.
3. Click any skill option in the dropdown list.
4. Re-open the `Skills` dropdown and click the same skill again to unselect it.

#### Expected Results
- The skills dropdown closes immediately after each selection click.
- Selected skill appears as a chip above the composer input when checked.
- Skill chip is removed when the skill is unchecked on the next selection.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the selected skill chip(s) before leaving the thread, if needed.

### Feature: Skills Hub manual search trigger

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Open the `Skills Hub` view.

#### Steps
1. Type a unique query value in the Skills Hub search input (for example: `docker`), but do not press Enter or click Search yet.
2. Confirm the browse results do not refresh immediately while typing.
3. Click the `Search` button.
4. Change the query text to another value and press Enter in the input.
5. Clear the query, then click `Search` to reload the default browse list.

#### Expected Results
- Typing alone does not trigger remote Skills Hub search requests.
- Results refresh only after explicit submit via the `Search` button or Enter key.
- Empty-state text (if shown) references the last submitted query.
- Submitting an empty query returns the default skills listing.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear the search input and run a blank search to return to default listing.

### Feature: Dark theme for trending GitHub projects and local project dropdown

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.
- `GitHub trending projects` setting is enabled.

#### Steps
1. On the home/new-thread screen, inspect the `Choose folder` dropdown trigger.
2. Open the `Choose folder` dropdown and confirm menu/option contrast remains readable in dark mode.
3. Inspect the `Trending GitHub projects` section title, scope dropdown, and project cards.
4. Hover a trending project card and the scope dropdown trigger.
5. Toggle appearance back to `Light`, then return to `Dark`.

#### Expected Results
- Local project dropdown trigger/value uses dark theme colors with readable contrast.
- Trending section title, empty/loading text, scope dropdown, and cards use dark backgrounds/borders/text.
- Hover states in dark mode stay visible and do not switch to light backgrounds.
- Theme switch back/forth preserves correct styling for both controls.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset appearance to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Dark theme for worktree runtime selector and Skills Hub

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.
- Skills Hub route is accessible.

#### Steps
1. Open the home/new-thread screen and inspect the `Local project / New worktree` runtime selector trigger.
2. Open the runtime selector and verify menu title, options, selected state, and checkmark visibility in dark mode.
3. Trigger a worktree action that shows worktree status and verify running/error status blocks remain readable in dark mode.
4. Open `Skills Hub` and verify header/subtitle, search bar, search/sort buttons, sync panel, badges, and status text.
5. Verify at least one skill card surface (title, owner, description, date, browse icon) in dark mode.
6. Open a skill detail modal and verify panel, title/owner, close button, README/body text, and footer actions in dark mode.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime dropdown trigger and menu use dark backgrounds, borders, and readable text/icons.
- Worktree status blocks use dark-friendly contrast for both running and error states.
- Skills Hub controls and sync panel are fully dark-themed with consistent hover/active states.
- Skill cards and the skill detail modal render with dark theme colors and accessible contrast.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset appearance to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Markdown file links with backticks and parentheses render correctly

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.
- Local file exists at `/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt`.

#### Steps
1. Send a message containing: `Done. Created [`/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt`](/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt) with content:`.
2. In the rendered assistant message, click the `/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt` link.
3. Right-click the same link and choose `Copy link` from the context menu.
4. Paste the copied link into a text field and inspect it.

#### Expected Results
- The markdown link renders as one clickable file link (not split into partial tokens).
- Clicking opens the local browse route for the full file path.
- Copied link includes the full encoded path and still resolves to the same file.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete `/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt` if it was created only for this test.

### Feature: Runtime selector uses a toggle-style control

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.

#### Steps
1. On the home/new-thread screen, locate the runtime control below `Choose folder`.
2. Verify both options (`Local project` and `New worktree`) are visible at once without opening a menu.
3. Click `New worktree` and confirm it becomes the selected option style.
4. Click `Local project` and confirm selection returns.
5. Set Appearance to `Dark` in Settings and verify selected/unselected contrast remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime mode is presented as a two-option toggle (segmented control), not a dropdown menu.
- Clicking each option immediately switches the selected state.
- Selected option has a distinct active background/border in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave runtime mode and appearance at the previous user preference.

### Feature: Dark theme states for runtime mode toggle

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.

#### Steps
1. Locate the runtime mode toggle (`Local project` and `New worktree`) under `Choose folder`.
2. Hover each option and verify hover state is visible against dark backgrounds.
3. Select `New worktree`, then select `Local project` and compare active/inactive contrast.
4. Tab to the toggle options with keyboard navigation and verify the focus ring is visible.
5. Confirm icon color remains readable for selected and unselected options.

#### Expected Results
- Toggle container, options, and text/icons use dark-friendly colors.
- Hover and selected states are clearly distinguishable in dark mode.
- Keyboard focus ring is visible and does not blend into the background.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Return appearance and runtime selection to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Provider-backed models appear in the model picker

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Codex is configured with a non-default `model_provider` that exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/models` endpoint.
- The configured provider can be reached from the host running codexUI.

#### Steps
1. From the same browser session, request `GET /codex-api/provider-models` and confirm the response is JSON.
2. Verify the response contains the active `providerId` and a non-empty `data` array of model ids.
3. Open or refresh a thread in the UI and open the model picker in the composer.
4. Confirm the provider-backed model ids from `/codex-api/provider-models` appear in the picker alongside the built-in Codex model list.
5. Stop the upstream provider or block access to it, then refresh the UI and reopen the model picker.

#### Expected Results
- `/codex-api/provider-models` returns `{ source: "provider", providerId, data }` for the active provider.
- Provider-backed models appear once each in the model picker and remain selectable.
- When the provider endpoint is unavailable, the UI still loads and the model picker falls back to the built-in model list without hanging indefinitely.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore provider connectivity if it was intentionally interrupted for the failure-path check.

### Feature: Home screen project picker improves project selection and creation UX

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- Access to the server filesystem used by codexUI.
- At least one writable parent directory exists for creating a test folder.

#### Steps
1. On the home screen, verify the primary folder action is `Select folder`.
2. Click `Select folder` and confirm codexUI opens an in-page folder picker card instead of navigating away from the home screen.
3. Confirm the picker shows the current absolute folder with an `Open` action, a `Show hidden folders` toggle, a toggle-style `New folder` action, a folder filter input, and a scrollable single-line list of subfolders inside the same UI shell.
4. Enter a substring in the filter input and verify the list narrows to folders whose names contain that text, while `..` remains available for navigation.
5. When the current folder has a parent, confirm the first row in the list is `..`, use it to navigate upward, then browse into an existing subfolder and use the `Open` action without leaving the home screen.
6. Confirm hidden folders are not shown by default, then enable `Show hidden folders` and verify hidden folders appear before regular folders in the list.
7. Use `New folder` from inside the picker and confirm a compact inline create row appears below the controls without repeating the current directory path.
8. Enter a single folder name and confirm the `Create` action sits on the same row as the text input.
9. Click `New folder` again and confirm the inline create row collapses instead of showing a separate cancel action.
10. Re-open the inline create row, submit a single folder name, and confirm codexUI creates the folder and navigates the picker into that new child directory without immediately opening it as the selected project.
11. From that newly created directory, click `Open` and confirm it becomes the selected folder in codexUI.

#### Expected Results
- The home screen uses a single `Select folder` entry point for choosing or creating a local project.
- Folder creation stays inside the same integrated picker card rather than using a separate browser-style or standalone create panel.
- Large directory listings stay contained inside a scrollable picker area instead of overlapping the rest of the home screen or composer area.
- Parent navigation appears as a `..` row in the list, folder names can be filtered by substring, and hidden folders remain hidden unless explicitly requested.
- Creating a folder from the picker uses a compact single-row composer, can be dismissed by clicking `New folder` again, and creates the folder inside the current directory before navigating into it while keeping final project selection explicit via `Open`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any temporary test folder created during the manual check.

### Feature: pnpm dev script installs dependencies and starts Vite

#### Prerequisites
- `pnpm` is installed globally (`npm i -g pnpm` or via corepack).
- Repository is cloned and `node_modules/` does not exist (or may be stale).

#### Steps
1. Remove `node_modules/` if present: `rm -rf node_modules`.
2. Run `pnpm run dev`.
3. Wait for Vite dev server to start and display the local URL.
4. Open the displayed URL in a browser.

#### Expected Results
- `pnpm install` runs automatically before Vite starts (dependencies are installed).
- Vite dev server starts successfully and serves the app.
- No `npm` commands are invoked.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Stop button interrupts active turn without missing turnId

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread can run a long response (for example, request a large code explanation).

#### Steps
1. Send a prompt that keeps the assistant generating for several seconds.
2. Immediately click the `Stop` button before the first assistant chunk fully completes.
3. Confirm generation halts.
4. Repeat with a resumed/existing in-progress thread (reload app while a turn is running, then click `Stop`).

#### Expected Results
- No error appears saying `turn/interrupt requires turnId`.
- Turn is interrupted successfully in both immediate-stop and resumed-thread scenarios.
- Thread state exits in-progress and the stop control returns to idle.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Revert PR #16 mobile viewport and chat scroll behavior changes

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough messages to scroll.
- Test on a mobile-sized viewport (for example 375x812).

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread and scroll up to the middle of the chat history.
2. Wait for an assistant response to stream while staying at the same scroll position.
3. Send a follow-up message and observe chat positioning when completion finishes.
4. Open the composer on mobile and drag within the composer area.
5. Open/close the on-screen keyboard on mobile and verify the page layout remains usable.

#### Expected Results
- Chat behavior matches pre-PR #16 baseline (no PR #16 scroll-preservation logic active).
- No regressions from reverting PR #16 changes in conversation rendering and composer behavior.
- Mobile layout no longer includes PR #16 visual-viewport sync changes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-apply PR #16 commits if the reverted behavior is not desired.

### Feature: Thread load capped to latest 10 turns

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread exists with more than 10 turns/messages.

#### Steps
1. Open a long thread that previously caused UI lag during initial load.
2. While the thread is loading, immediately click another thread in the sidebar.
3. Return to the long thread.
4. Count visible loaded history blocks and confirm only the newest portion is shown.
5. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/read` for the same thread and inspect `result.thread.turns.length`.
6. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/resume` for the same thread and inspect `result.thread.turns.length`.

#### Expected Results
- Initial thread load renders only the most recent 10 turns.
- UI remains responsive during thread load.
- You can switch to another thread without the UI freezing.
- `thread/read` and `thread/resume` RPC responses contain at most 10 turns.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Skills list request scoped to active thread cwd

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Browser DevTools Network tab is open.
- At least two threads exist with different `cwd` values.

#### Steps
1. Reload the app and wait for initial data load.
2. In Network tab, inspect `/codex-api/rpc` requests with method `skills/list`.
3. Verify request params contain `cwds` with only the currently selected thread cwd.
4. Switch to another thread with a different cwd.
5. Inspect the next `skills/list` request and verify `cwds` now contains only the new selected thread cwd.

#### Expected Results
- `skills/list` no longer sends every thread cwd in one request.
- Each `skills/list` call includes at most one cwd for the active thread context.
- Skills list still updates when changing selected thread.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: GitHub Website Redesign — OpenClaw-Inspired Design + Web Demo Link

#### Prerequisites
- The `docs/index.html` file has been updated with the new design.
- A browser is available to view the page locally or via GitHub Pages.

#### Steps
1. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (local file or via GitHub Pages).
2. Verify the fixed **navigation bar** at top with brand logo, section links, and "Get the App" CTA.
3. Verify the **announcement banner** below nav shows the XCodex WASM link.
4. Verify **hero section** displays lobster emoji, "AnyClaw" title with gradient, tagline, and four CTA buttons: "Try Web Demo", "Google Play", "Download APK", "GitHub".
5. Click **"Try Web Demo"** button — confirm it navigates to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
6. Verify the **stats bar** shows key metrics (2 AI Agents, 1 APK, 0 Root Required, 73MB, infinity).
7. Scroll to **Live Demo** section — verify embedded iframe loads `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` with mock browser chrome.
8. Scroll to **Screenshots** section — verify four images render (2 desktop, 2 mobile).
9. Scroll to **Features** section — verify 6 feature cards in a 3-column grid.
10. Scroll to **Testimonials** section — verify two rows of auto-scrolling marquee cards (row 2 scrolls reverse). Hover to pause.
11. Scroll through **Architecture**, **Boot Sequence**, **Quick Start**, and **Tech Stack** sections — verify content renders.
12. Verify the **footer** includes a "Web Demo" link to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
13. Test responsive at 768px and 480px — nav links collapse, grids single-column, buttons stack vertically.

#### Expected Results
- Page has a dark, premium feel with gradient accents, grain overlay, and smooth animations.
- All links to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` work (announcement, hero CTA, demo section, quick start text, footer).
- Marquee testimonials scroll continuously and pause on hover.
- Embedded iframe demo loads successfully.
- Mobile responsive layout works at all breakpoints.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert `docs/index.html` to previous commit if needed.

### Feature: Keep manual chat scroll position during streaming

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough history to allow scrolling away from bottom.

#### Steps
1. Open the thread and scroll upward so latest messages are not visible.
2. Send a new message that produces a streaming assistant response.
3. During streaming, do not scroll and observe viewport position.
4. After streaming completes, verify the viewport remains at the same manual position.

#### Expected Results
- Streaming updates do not force auto-scroll to the bottom when user has manually scrolled away.
- User can continue reading older history while the response streams.
- If the thread is already at the bottom when streaming starts, the latest streaming overlay remains visible.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the scroll-preservation change in `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue` if manual scroll locking needs to be removed.

### Feature: Rollback API/UI no longer requires turn index in rollback payload

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with at least 2 completed turns.
- Rollback control is visible in the thread conversation message actions.

#### Steps
1. Open any existing thread with multiple turns.
2. In DevTools Network tab, keep `/codex-api/rpc` requests visible.
3. Click rollback on a user or assistant message that is not the newest one.
4. Confirm rollback succeeds and the thread is truncated to the selected turn.
5. Inspect the UI event flow by repeating rollback from a different turn and confirm the selected message can rollback without relying on a numeric turn index.
6. Use dictation resend flow (or "rollback latest user turn" flow) and confirm the latest user turn is rolled back correctly.

#### Expected Results
- Rollback works when triggered from message actions using `turnId` as the identifier.
- No UI path depends on `turnIndex` in rollback event payloads.
- Latest-user-turn rollback flow still works and targets the latest user `turnId`.
- No TypeScript/runtime errors are introduced in rollback interaction.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the updated files if this behavior is not desired:
  - `src/types/codex.ts`
  - `src/api/normalizers/v2.ts`
  - `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue`
  - `src/App.vue`
  - `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts`

### Feature: Rollback init commit includes `.codex/.gitignore`

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Use a fresh temporary project directory with no existing `.codex/rollbacks/.git` history.

#### Steps
1. In a fresh test project folder, trigger rollback automation init by calling `/codex-api/worktree/auto-commit` with a valid commit message.
2. Verify rollback repo exists at `.codex/rollbacks/.git`.
3. In that rollback repo, run `git --git-dir .codex/rollbacks/.git --work-tree . show --name-only --pretty=format: HEAD`.
4. Confirm `.codex/.gitignore` appears in the file list for the init commit.
5. Open `.codex/.gitignore` and verify `rollbacks/` exists.

#### Expected Results
- First rollback-history commit is `Initialize rollback history`.
- That commit includes `.codex/.gitignore`.
- `.codex/.gitignore` contains `rollbacks/`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the temporary test folder after verification.

### Feature: Deterministic rollback commit + exact lookup with debug logs

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- `worktree git automation` is enabled in UI settings.
- Test thread available where you can send at least 3 user turns.

#### Steps
1. Send a user turn that changes files and completes.
2. Send a user turn that produces no file edits and completes.
3. Send a third user turn and complete it.
4. In rollback git history (`.codex/rollbacks/.git`), verify each completed turn created a commit, including the no-edit turn.
5. Inspect one rollback commit body and confirm it contains the user message text plus `Rollback-User-Message-SHA256: <hash>`.
6. Trigger rollback to the second turn message via UI rollback action.
7. Verify server logs contain `[rollback-debug]` entries for lookup, stash (if dirty), reset, and completion.
8. Temporarily test missing-commit path by calling `/codex-api/worktree/rollback-to-message` with a non-existent message text.

#### Expected Results
- Auto-commit creates a rollback commit for every completed turn (`--allow-empty` behavior).
- Commit body includes the user message and stable hash trailer.
- Rollback uses exact hash-based commit lookup only.
- If exact commit is missing, rollback returns error and does not continue.
- Server logs include `[rollback-debug]` records for commit creation, lookup, stash, reset, and error paths.
- Browser console includes `[rollback-debug]` client-side start/success/error logs for auto-commit and rollback API calls.
- Rollback init no longer fails when `.codex` is ignored globally; init force-adds `.codex/.gitignore`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the changed files if you want previous non-deterministic behavior back.

### Feature: Per-turn changed files panel with lazy diff loading

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Worktree git automation enabled.
- A thread with at least one completed turn that touched files.

#### Steps
1. Open a thread and locate a `Worked for ...` separator message.
2. Expand the worked separator.
3. Verify a changed-files panel appears above command details.
4. Confirm file list entries show file path and `+/-` counts.
5. Click one changed file row to expand it.
6. Verify diff content loads only after expansion (lazy load behavior).
7. Collapse and re-expand the same file row; verify diff reuses loaded content.
8. Switch to another thread and back; verify panel reloads for the active thread context.

#### Expected Results
- Each worked message can show changed files for its turn.
- Diff for a file is fetched only on expand, not for all files upfront.
- Errors (missing commit/diff load failure) are shown inline in the panel.
- Existing command output expand/collapse behavior remains unchanged.
- Changed-files panel still resolves after page refresh or app-server restart.
- Changed-files panel appears at the end of the worked message block (after command rows).

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Worked separator is non-expandable

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- A thread with at least one `Worked for ...` separator.

#### Steps
1. Open a thread and locate a `Worked for ...` message.
2. Click the separator line/text area.
3. Verify no expand/collapse behavior is triggered on the separator itself.
4. Verify changed-files panel still appears below the separator when data exists.

#### Expected Results
- `Worked for ...` acts as a visual separator only (non-interactive).
- Changed-files and command sections are not gated by a worked-separator expand toggle.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Changed-files lookup fallback when turnId metadata is missing

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Playwright CLI available.

#### Steps
1. Create/prepare a test workspace (example: `/tmp/rollback-pw`).
2. Call `/codex-api/worktree/auto-commit` with:
   - `cwd=/tmp/rollback-pw`
   - `message='pw-msg-turn-1'`
   - `turnId='turn-real-1'`
3. Call `/codex-api/worktree/message-changes` with:
   - same `cwd`
   - same `message`
   - mismatched `turnId='turn-wrong'`
4. Verify response is still `200` and returns the matching commit data (message-hash fallback).
5. Capture Playwright artifact screenshot.

#### Expected Results
- `message-changes` first attempts turnId lookup.
- If turnId lookup misses, it falls back to exact message-hash lookup.
- API returns commit data instead of `No matching commit found for this user message` when message matches.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test workspace if created.

### Feature: Changed-files panel persists across refresh (assistant message level)

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Existing thread in `TestChat` project with completed assistant messages.
- Worktree rollback auto-commit enabled.

#### Steps
1. Open a `TestChat` thread and confirm assistant message cards render.
2. Verify changed-files panel is shown at the end of assistant messages that have rollback commit data.
3. Hard refresh the page.
4. Re-open the same `TestChat` thread.
5. Verify changed-files panel is still shown for the same assistant message(s).
6. Expand one file diff and verify diff content loads.

#### Expected Results
- Changed-files panel is attached to assistant messages (not transient worked separators).
- Changed-files panel appears only once per turn (on the last assistant message in that turn).
- Changed-files panel is hidden while a turn is still in progress.
- Panels remain available after refresh/restart because lookup is turnId/message-hash based.
- File diff expansion still lazy-loads and displays content.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Rollback debug logs controlled by `.env`

#### Prerequisites
- App server stopped.
- Edit `.env` directly, and use `.env.local` for private local overrides.

#### Steps
1. Set `ROLLBACK_DEBUG=0` and `VITE_ROLLBACK_DEBUG=0` in `.env`.
2. Start app and trigger rollback auto-commit/message-changes flow.
3. Verify `[rollback-debug]` logs are not emitted in terminal/browser console.
4. Set `ROLLBACK_DEBUG=1` and `VITE_ROLLBACK_DEBUG=1` in `.env`.
5. Restart app and trigger the same flow again.
6. Verify `[rollback-debug]` logs appear in terminal/browser console.

#### Expected Results
- Debug logs are disabled when env flags are `0`.
- Debug logs are enabled when env flags are `1`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore `.env` values to preferred defaults.

### Feature: Auto-commit default is disabled for new preference state

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Browser local storage key `codex-web-local.worktree-git-automation.v1` is absent (new user state).

#### Steps
1. Open the app in a fresh browser profile (or clear only `codex-web-local.worktree-git-automation.v1`).
2. Open Settings and inspect the `Rollback commits` toggle state.
3. Confirm it starts in the disabled/off state.
4. Enable the toggle manually.
5. Reload the page and confirm the toggle remains enabled.
6. Disable it again, reload, and confirm it remains disabled.

#### Expected Results
- Default state is disabled when no prior preference exists.
- User-selected state persists via local storage across reloads.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: PR20 composer attachment audit fixes

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- A thread with an enabled composer is open.
- One image file and one non-image file are available for drag-and-drop tests.
- Clipboard content that includes both plain text and an image is available.
- A way to hold or fail `/codex-api/upload-file` requests is available, such as browser network tools, a proxy, or a backend breakpoint.

#### Steps
1. Start dragging a file over the composer until the drop overlay appears, then move the pointer outside the window and release without dropping on the composer.
2. Drag one file onto the composer and wait for it to finish attaching.
3. Copy clipboard content that includes both plain text and an image, then paste it into the composer with `Ctrl+V`.
4. Start a multi-file attachment batch with at least two files, then make one upload fail immediately or hold one `/codex-api/upload-file` request open long enough to hit the 60 second timeout while another file succeeds.
5. After the failed batch settles, attach one additional valid file to confirm a new batch still works.

#### Expected Results
- The drag overlay disappears after the cancelled drag and does not stay stuck on the composer.
- A normal file drop still attaches the file successfully.
- Mixed paste keeps the plain text in the textarea and also adds the pasted image attachment.
- Failed or timed-out uploads stop showing as pending, submit becomes available again after all attachment work settles, and the composer shows a mixed-result message such as `1 attached, 1 failed`.
- A follow-up attachment batch can still complete normally after a previous failure summary.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Turn off any network blocking, proxy rule, or backend breakpoint used to simulate the failure.
- Remove any temporary attachments from the composer before continuing other tests.
- Stop the app server when finished.

### Feature: Home no-thread composer alignment

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- At least one workspace/project is available so the home screen renders normally.

#### Steps
1. Open the app to the home/new-thread screen (no thread selected).
2. Inspect the horizontal alignment of the message composer input relative to the home content above it (`Let's build`, folder selector, runtime section).
3. Resize the window between narrow and wide desktop widths.
4. Start a new thread and then navigate back to the home/new-thread screen.

#### Expected Results
- On the home/no-thread screen, the composer container is centered and aligned with the main content column.
- The composer input no longer appears horizontally offset compared with the content above.
- Alignment remains stable across desktop width changes and after returning from a thread.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
